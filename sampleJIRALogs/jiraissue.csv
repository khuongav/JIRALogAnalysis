That will impact to performance of driver.Validation should be execute on process handlers. If driver detect invalid data, it will discard invalid part and continue process.Please check and consider my comment.",null,3,11,5,2015-01-27 06:20:22.203,2015-02-04 09:42:57.692,2015-01-27 06:20:22.911,2015-02-04 09:42:57.641,0.0,NULL,NULL,NULL,222036.0,10126.0,NULL,NULL,2.0
